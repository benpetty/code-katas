"""Python Practice: Distance Between Points.

Below is a function that will calculate the shortest distance
between any two points on the Earthâ€™s surface.
Do not worry about how it works.
It is simply a tool for this exercise.:

------- calculate_distance(point1, point2) ---------------------------------- #

The JSON file at this URL (contains some cities with international airports,
each with a latitude, a longitude, and a city that it connects to.
For the curious, the list of airports comes from Wikipedia.

Write a function that,

- given a starting city and an ending city,
will return a path between the two cities (including the two cities).
- also returns the total distance traveled between cities.
- appropriately handles the situation where no path exists.

Stretch Goals---------------------------------------------------------------- #
Try to incorporate any (or all) of these.
They are/can be independent of each other.

- Add to your function a parameter that makes it return
the shortest path (lowest distance) between the two cities.
- Add to your function a parameter that makes it return
the path with the fewest stops between the two cities.
- Have your function take a parameter for
a limit to the distance between any two cities.
- If specified, your function returns a path where each city-to-city jump
is less than or equal to that limit.
